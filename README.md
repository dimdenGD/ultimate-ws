# Ultimate WS

Ultimate WS is a faster replacement for `ws` module, with support for [Ultimate Express](https://github.com/dimdenGD/ultimate-express) http upgrades. It uses [uWebSockets.js](https://github.com/uNetworking/uWebSockets.js) under the hood.  
  
It's useful when:
- You want same API as `ws` module, but the speed of `uWebSockets.js`
- You want to convert your Express app with `ws` to use [Ultimate Express](https://github.com/dimdenGD/ultimate-express) instead

`npm install ultimate-ws`
